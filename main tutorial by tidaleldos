First, before using setpm.bat script, you may wish to backup original SettingsEnvironment.Desktop.dll file permissions. You can do this using icacls.exe /save option. To restore original owner and saved permissions, use the icacls.exe /setowner and /restore options.

Run the setpm.bat script to set the required permissions (or set them manually). This is needed, because by default, only TrustedInstaller is allowed to modify files inside System32 folder.

After modifying file owner and permissions, run sunlock11.exe. Both the script and the unlock tool require administrative privileges, so make sure that you execute them as administraton . Code written by revengsk
